Why we decided to take a break and re-invent TNDS

When asked, I usually recall a cold November afternoon in 2014 as the official “ta-da” moment, when the idea of building a new design school was first spoken out loud. I was sitting at the Duke of York in Belfast, having a pint of Guinness with my good friend Christopher Murphy after his Break Conf, the kind of special moment that doesn’t happen very often.

The ideas for better ways of getting young people to learn digital design were pouring out of our mouths like red hot lava from a volcano, such was the passion in our tone and the spark in our eyes. We had this thing! We were out to change the world… And we sort of did!

Fast forward 4 years and the world kept mutating and so did the challenges we pointed out. The determination of not settling in, however, that is is still very much alive and has been put to good use.

Since then, without being totally sure of what we were doing we rallied the love and intent of thousands of supporters around a school that didn’t yet existed, received applications from 26 different countries, had the faith of some of those people in our hands for 2 years in a row, and together saw their lives and careers change entirely.

At the start of 2019, most of our students from the latest class had already been hired, and we received much love for being able to put together a new design education paradigm. Comments about the remarkable strategic thinking and work capacity of our students were positive and everybody applauded for each little move we took.

Still, this was no walk in the park.

# The Sabbatical

Throughout these last couple of years, it was always with a great sense of responsibility that we got up in the morning. And by September 2018, we were exhausted. Overwhelmed by all that had happened and all the work. I now look back and realize that personally, I was on the verge of burnout.

And so, aiming for the same high standards that lead us from the start, we decided to turn 2019 into a gap year: a time for reflection, revisions, improvements and new plans, applying all of the problem-solving attitude that we so passionately advocate for to find our own solutions.

We learned a lot about education, business, design as a business, design as a craft and mostly… about people. But it wouldn’t be fair for us or anyone involved to keep pushing continuity under pressure just for the sake of keeping that same continuity, as most startups feel like they have to.

\ Like many preconceptions we challenged before, in this case pushing continuity would be a mistake.

There are several things we want to change in how the school works, making it more streamlined, adjusted to the students’ reality, as well as to that of companies we collaborate with. And so, armed with that passion and a sense of humbleness, and all the learnings from the past 2+ years we think the next edition of TNDS is going to ROCK! :)

The Future

We aim to be back in 2020 with V3 of TNDS, hoping to do our part in changing how education is done and boosting the impact of design in the world.

We’re working to help new designers, seasoned professionals and probably even people beyond Design, not just through hard work but harnessing other forces such as the raw power of goodwill and collaboration within a community. And by helping we mean giving people what they need to grow as individuals and professionals, so they too can leave a positive mark in the world.

For now, we’re once again out to design something amazing with lots of exciting plans. Let us know if you want to make part of them and help: hi@thenewdigitalschool.com
